    <p>This topic describes the 
    	<strong>open-store:</strong> URI scheme. Your app can use this URI scheme to launch 
    	<strong>any third-party</strong> Store app to specific pages in the store by using the 
    	<a href="/Guides/uwp/api/windows.system.launcher.launchuriasync"><strong>LaunchUriAsync</strong></a> method.
    </p>
    <p>For example, you can open a Store to it's Games page using the following code:</p>
    <div class="code">
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td class="code-title">Launch a Store's Gaming Collection - C#</td>
                    <td><button onclick="App.Code.Copy(this);">Copy</button></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <code codelang="CSharp">
            <pre>using Windows.System;

Uri uri = new Uri(&quot;open-store://navigatetopage/?Id=Gaming&quot;);
bool result = await Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uri);</pre>
        </code>

    </div>
    <p>You can launch a Store app to a specific collections page or section using the following options.</p>
    <div>
    	<table>
    		<thead>
    			<tr>
    				<th>URI Scheme</th>
    				<th>Description</th>
    				<th>Notes</th>
    			</tr>

    		<tbody>
    			<tr>
    				<td>open-store://home</td>
    				<td>Launches the home page of a Store app.</td>
    				<td></td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>open-store://navigatetopage/?Id=[collection]</td>
    				<td>Launches a Store app to the specified collection if supported by the Store app. If not, prompt the user wether to dismiss or re-launch the URI. (Possibly to be handled by a different Store app.)</td>
    				<td>Collections include: 
    					<code>Home</code>, 
    					<code>Gaming</code>, 
    					<code>Entertainment</code>, 
    					<code>Productivity</code>, 
    					<code>Mods</code>, and 
    					<code>Tools</code>, but note that available collections can vary by Store app and they may have additional collections.
    				</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>open-store://downloadsandupdates</td>
    				<td>Launches the downloads and updates page. (This should not be used as a trigger for updating.)</td>
    				<td>This is probably not supported by most Store apps.</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>open-store://settings</td>
    				<td>Launches a Store's settings page.</td>
    				<td></td>
    			</tr>

    </div>
    <p>Due to the fact that in practice it's impossible for all Stores to share the same database  with the same UID for each package (which would also defeat the purpose of having more than one), we need to use something more reliable. By using a classic Product ID for an app you can't launch an open-store client directly to a product detail page (PDP) for a specific product. The logical solution to this problem is to use something that can be safely assumed is different for each package, but the same for identical packages in all Stores. This way we can find them without the need of a database between Stores. This is where the Package Family Name (PFN) or App ID shines. These values can be found in the App's manifest and are a clear identifier of each app no matter in which Store they are.</p>
